# Data Science Foundations: Exercises and Projects

This repository contains my exercises and projects focused on the foundational mathematical concepts essential for understanding and implementing data science algorithms. The exercises cover linear algebra, probability, statistics, and calculus, providing a deep dive into how these disciplines underpin machine learning models. Additionally, I've included three projects that apply these concepts to real-world problems.

## Exercises

### Linear Algebra

- Vectors and Matrices: Implementations and operations.
- Matrix Multiplication: Practical examples in data transformation.
- Inversions and Determinant: Understanding system solvability.
- Trace and Norm: Applications in model regularization.
- Diagonal Matrices: Their role in data scaling and simplification.

### Probability

- Gaussian Distribution: Analysis and applications.
- Probability Distributions: Exploring different types and their significance.

### Statistics

- Random Variables: Understanding mean and variance.
- Covariance and Correlation: Exploring relationships between data points.

### Calculus

- Derivatives and Chain Rule: Implementations for optimization problems.

## Projects

### 1. Predicting Housing Prices Using Linear Regression

This project applies linear regression to predict housing prices based on various features. It showcases the use of statistical concepts to select relevant features and linear algebra to implement the regression model.

### 2. Image Filtering and Edge Detection Using Sobel Filters

An exploration of applying Sobel filters for edge detection in images. This project demonstrates the application of matrix operations in image processing and edge detection techniques.

### 3. Analyzing and Visualizing the Gaussian Distribution

A detailed analysis and visualization of Gaussian distributions in data sets. This project uses statistical methods to analyze data distributions and provides insights into data normalization and standardization techniques.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python
- NumPy and SciPy for mathematical operations
- Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization
- scikit-learn for machine learning models
