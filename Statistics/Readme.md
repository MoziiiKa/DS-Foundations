Data Science and Computer Vision Exercises
Welcome to my GitHub repository dedicated to exploring foundational concepts crucial for data science and computer vision. This repository contains exercises and examples on Random Variables, Mean, and Variance, showcasing their applications and importance in the fields of data science and computer vision.

Overview
In this repository, we dive deep into three core statistical concepts:

Random Variables: Essential for modeling uncertainty and variability in data, which are pervasive in computer vision and data science tasks.
Mean: A fundamental measure of central tendency that helps in summarizing, normalizing data sets, and understanding their general behavior.
Variance: Critical for assessing the spread and diversity of data, indicating the variability and reliability of the data set or predictions.
Each topic is presented through detailed exercises that combine theoretical insights with practical applications, enhancing understanding and proficiency in these areas.
