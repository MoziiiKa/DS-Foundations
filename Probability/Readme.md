# **Linear Algebra Exercises for Data Science and Computer Vision**

This repository contains a collection of exercises and examples demonstrating key concepts in linear algebra with applications in data science and computer vision. The goal is to provide a practical understanding of how linear algebra underpins algorithms and techniques in these fields.

## **Overview**

Linear algebra is a fundamental area of mathematics necessary for understanding and designing algorithms in data science and computer vision. This repository focuses on the practical application of linear algebra concepts in these areas, including but not limited to Gaussian distributions, probability distributions, matrix operations, eigenvalues and eigenvectors, and their significance in real-world applications.

## **Gaussian Distribution**

### **Definition and Characteristics**

We start with an introduction to the Gaussian (normal) distribution, emphasizing its symmetry about the mean and its bell-shaped curve. This section includes a detailed explanation of the mathematical formula and the significance of the mean (μ) and standard deviation (σ) in shaping the distribution.

### **Application in Data Science and Computer Vision**

Discusses the foundational role of the Gaussian distribution in understanding noise in images, smoothing techniques, and its necessity in statistical analysis for hypothesis testing and data normalization.

## **Probability Distributions**

### **General Concept**

An overview of probability distributions, distinguishing between discrete and continuous types, and their importance in modeling uncertainties and making predictions.

### **Examples and Applications**

- **Discrete Distributions**: Focuses on the binomial distribution with real-world examples.
- **Continuous Distributions**: Explains the uniform distribution and its applications, alongside the Gaussian distribution for a comprehensive understanding.
