# **Data Science Projects**

This repository contains a collection of data science projects showcasing various techniques from linear regression analysis to image processing and statistical analysis. Each project is designed to provide insights into different aspects of data science and machine learning.

## **Projects Overview**

- **Predicting Housing Prices Using Linear Regression**: This project applies linear regression to predict housing prices based on various features like the size of the house, the number of rooms, and the age of the house. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using Scikit-learn.
- **Image Filtering and Edge Detection Using Sobel Filters**: An exploration into image processing techniques, specifically focusing on the use of Sobel filters for edge detection. This project illustrates how to apply convolutional filters to detect edges in images, highlighting the fundamentals of image filtering.
- **Analyzing and Visualizing the Gaussian Distribution**: A statistical analysis project that dives into the properties of the Gaussian distribution. It includes generating synthetic data, visualizing the distribution, and applying statistical tests to understand the distribution's characteristics.
